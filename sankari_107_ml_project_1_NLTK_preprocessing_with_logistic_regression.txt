Fake_news_prediction_Project:

1. This project is going to discuss about the news, whether it is real or fake?

2. About the dataset:
In this data set, there are 5 columns, which are (id, title, author, text, and label)
id----->it is the unique customer for the news article
title-----> the title of the news article
author----->the author of the article
text--------> the text of the article
label------>the news is real or fake. {If the news is real--->0 and if the news is fake---->1}

3. imported packages and usage:
import pandas as pd -----> to create the dataframe
import numpy as np--------> to create the numpy array
import re------> re means regular expression which is used to search the text(words) in the dataset.
corpus------>content or body of the text file.
NLTK ----> Natural Language Toolkit, which is a file preprocessing toolkit for the text data set.
Stemming ----->which is one type of normalization process in the NLP. The purpose of this function is to remove the prefix and suffix of the word and return the root word of it.
TF-IDF(Team Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)----> is used to convert from the textual data into numeric data by vectorizer.
To split the data for training and test
Initialize the model
Import the accuracy score metric

4. Data Preprocessing:
4.1 I have read the dataset using a pandas dataframe  
4.2 print the first 5 columns
4.3 finding the missing values
4.4 filled by empty string(null string)
4.5 merge the title and author. We may use the text file to merge. but which is not necessary. because we already have enough data to predict the best model.

5. Stemming Process:
5.1 Define the function by the name of stemming
5.2 removed non-alphabetical values by re.sub('[a-zA_Z]')
5.3 lower() is used to only have lower case letters and split() is used to tokenize the words.
5.4. stemming the content column
5.5 back to join the words
5.6 apply the stemming function to the content column of the news_dataset

6. split the feature and the  targeted data

7. Converting from the textual data into numeric by vectorizer

8. splitting the training and test function

9. Use the Logistic Regression model.

10. Evaluate the training and test model accuracy by accuracy_score.

11. Make the prediction system
